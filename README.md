## Why CodeEvolve?

**State-of-the-art performance with transparency.** CodeEvolve matches or exceeds the performance of closed-source systems like Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve on established algorithm-discovery benchmarks, while remaining fully open and reproducible.

**Cost-effective solutions.** Open-weight models like Qwen often match or outperform expensive closed-source LLMs at a fraction of the compute cost, making cutting-edge algorithmic discovery accessible to researchers and practitioners with limited budgets.

**Designed for real problems.** CodeEvolve addresses meta-optimization tasks where you need to discover programs that solve complex optimization problems—from mathematical constructions to scientific discovery.

## Key Features

### Islands-based Genetic Algorithm

Multiple populations evolve independently and periodically exchange top performers, maintaining diversity while propagating successful solutions across the search space. This parallel architecture enables efficient exploration and scales naturally to concurrent evaluation.

### Modular Evolutionary Operators

**Inspiration-based Crossover:** Contextual recombination that combines successful solution patterns while preserving semantic coherence. Parent solutions are presented to the LLM along with high-performing "inspiration" programs, allowing it to synthesize novel combinations.

**Meta-prompting Exploration:** Evolves the prompts themselves, enabling the LLM to reflect on and rewrite its own instructions for more diverse search trajectories. The system maintains a population of prompts that co-evolve with solutions.

**Depth-based Exploitation:** Targeted refinement mechanism that makes precise edits to promising solutions by maintaining conversation history. The LLM sees the full evolutionary lineage, enabling incremental improvements while preserving working components.

### Quality-Diversity Optimization

**MAP-Elites Integration:** Optional quality-diversity archive that maintains behavioral diversity across the solution space. Supports both grid-based and CVT-based (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation) feature maps.

### Flexible LLM Integration

**Ensemble Support:** Mix and match multiple LLMs with weighted selection. Use different models for exploration vs. exploitation phases, or combine open-weight and proprietary models.

**OpenAI-Compatible APIs:** Works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint including vLLM, Ollama, Together AI, and cloud providers.

## How It Works

CodeEvolve operates as a distributed evolutionary algorithm where code itself is the evolving entity:

### The Evolutionary Loop

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial code template and system prompt that defines the task

2. **Selection**: Choose parent and inspiration programs based on fitness
   - **Exploration mode**: Random or uniform selection for broad search
   - **Exploitation mode**: Tournament or roulette selection for refinement

3. **Variation**: Generate new candidates through LLM-driven operations
   - **Exploration**: Broad modifications with meta-prompting
   - **Exploitation**: Targeted improvements with conversation history

4. **Code Generation**: LLM produces SEARCH/REPLACE diffs
   - Only specified code blocks are modified (between markers)
   - Preserves working code outside evolution zones
   - Applies structured diffs rather than regenerating entire files

5. **Evaluation**: Execute in sandboxed environment
   - Resource limits (time, memory)
   - Capture metrics and errors
   - Extract fitness from evaluation results

6. **Migration**: Periodically exchange top solutions between islands
   - Maintains diversity while spreading innovations
   - Prevents premature convergence

7. **Archiving** (optional): MAP-Elites maintains diverse solutions
   - Preserves behavioral variety
   - Increases diversity in a multi-objective setting

### Exploration vs Exploitation

The system dynamically balances exploration and exploitation:

| Phase | Selection | LLM Context | Operators |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Exploration** | Random | Random Inspirations | Meta-prompting exploration |
| **Exploitation** | Fitness | Best Inspirations + Full lineage | Depth exploitation |

The exploration rate is controlled by a scheduler (e.g., exponential decay) and can adapt based on fitness improvements.

### Distributed Islands

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│Island 0 │────▶│Island 1 │────▶│Island 2 │
│Pop: 20  │     │Pop: 20  │     │Pop: 20  │
└────┬────┘     └────┬────┘     └────┬────┘
     │               │               │
     └───────────────┴───────────────┘
        Periodic Migration (Ring Topology)
        
Each island maintains:
- Solution population
- Prompt population
- Local fitness rankings
- Migration history
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

Clone this repository and create the conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inter-co/science-codeevolve.git
cd science-codeevolve
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate codeevolve
```

### Basic Usage

Configure your LLM provider by setting environment variables:

```bash
export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export API_BASE=your_api_base_url
```

> `API_BASE` must point to an **OpenAI-compatible** API base URL (hosted provider, gateway, or local inference server).

Run CodeEvolve via the command line:

```bash
codeevolve \
  --inpt_dir=INPT_DIR \
  --cfg_path=CFG_PATH \
  --out_dir=RESULTS_DIR \
  --load_ckpt=LOAD_CKPT \
  --terminal_logging
```

**Arguments:**
- `--inpt_dir`: Directory containing the evaluation script and the initial codebase
- `--cfg_path`: Path to YAML configuration file (required for new runs)
- `--out_dir`: Directory where results will be saved
- `--load_ckpt`: Checkpoint to load (0 for new run, -1 for latest, or specific epoch)
- `--terminal_logging`: Enable live progress display (optional)

The `scripts/run.sh` provides a bash script for running CodeEvolve with `taskset` to limit CPU usage. See `src/codeevolve/cli.py` for further details.

### Minimal Example

Here's a complete minimal example for optimizing a simple function:

**1. Create problem directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p my_problem/input
```

**2. Create initial solution (`my_problem/input/solution.py`):**
```python
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
def objective(x):
    """Function to maximize."""
    return -(x - 3)**2 + 10
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = 0.0  # Initial guess
    result = objective(x)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**3. Create evaluator (`my_problem/input/evaluate.py`):**
```python
import sys
import json
import subprocess

def evaluate(code_path, results_path):
    # Run the solution
    result = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, code_path],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        timeout=10
    )
    
    # Extract fitness from output
    fitness = float(result.stdout.split(':')[1].strip())
    
    # Save results
    with open(results_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump({'fitness': fitness}, f)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    evaluate(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

**4. Create config (`my_problem/config.yaml`):**
```yaml
SEED: 42

CODEBASE_PATH: "."
EVAL_FILE_NAME: "evaluate.py"

INIT_FILE_DATA:
  filename: "solution.py"
  language: "python"

SYS_MSG: |
  # PROMPT-BLOCK-START
  You are an expert optimization algorithm designer. Your goal is to modify
  the given code to maximize the objective function.
  # PROMPT-BLOCK-END

ENSEMBLE:
  - model_name: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo"
    temp: 0.8
    weight: 1
    seed: 42

SAMPLER_AUX_LM:
  model_name: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo"
  temp: 0.7
  seed: 42

EVOLVE_CONFIG:
  num_epochs: 50
  num_islands: 2
  migration_topology: "directed_ring"
  migration_interval: 10
  
  selection_policy: "tournament"
  selection_kwargs:
    tournament_size: 3
  
  num_inspirations: 2
  exploration_rate: 0.3
  
  fitness_key: "fitness"
  ckpt: 10
  early_stopping_rounds: 20
```

**5. Run:**
```bash
codeevolve \
  --inpt_dir=my_problem/input \
  --cfg_path=my_problem/config.yaml \
  --out_dir=my_problem/results \
  --terminal_logging
```

### Customizing for Your Problem

CodeEvolve is designed for algorithmic problems with quantifiable metrics. To apply it to your domain:

1. **Define your evaluation function** that measures solution quality
   - Must accept: code file path, results file path
   - Must output: JSON with at least one metric field

2. **Specify the initial codebase** or problem structure
   - Mark evolution zones with `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`
   - Code outside these blocks is preserved

3. **Configure evolutionary parameters**
   - Population size, mutation rates, selection policy
   - Exploration/exploitation balance
   - Migration topology and frequency

4. **Choose your LLM ensemble composition**
   - Single model or multiple models
   - Separate ensembles for exploration vs exploitation
   - Weight distribution across models

See `problems/problem_template` for a general template. Comprehensive tutorials and example notebooks will be released soon.

## Use Cases

The framework is suitable for any domain where solutions can be represented as code and evaluated programmatically:

### Mathematical Discovery
- Finding solutions to open problems in mathematics
- Discovering new inequalities or bounds
- Constructing optimal geometric configurations

### Algorithm Design
- Optimizing computational kernels and scheduling algorithms
- Discovering novel heuristics for NP-hard problems
- Automated algorithm configuration

### Scientific Discovery
- Exploring hypothesis spaces expressed as executable code
- Parameter optimization for scientific models
- Automated experimental design

### Software Optimization
- Performance tuning of critical code paths
- Automatic parallelization strategies
- Resource allocation optimization

## Reproducibility & Determinism

CodeEvolve is designed to be **seedable for all internal algorithmic decisions** (selection, scheduling, migration, etc.). However, **exact end-to-end reproducibility depends on your LLM provider**:

- **Framework-level seeding**:
  - Set `SEED` in the YAML config to seed internal randomness.
  - In multi-island runs, each island derives a deterministic island seed (`SEED + island_id`) for its local stochastic decisions.
- **LLM seeding**:
  - Model configs can include a `seed` field, and CodeEvolve forwards it to OpenAI-compatible APIs.
  - Some providers do **not** support deterministic sampling and may ignore `seed` or still return nondeterministic outputs.

For hosted LLM APIs, treat results as **statistical**—run multiple seeds and compare distributions. If you use a fully controlled inference stack that supports deterministic decoding, you may get much closer to exact replay.
